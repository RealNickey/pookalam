# ‚ú®Code-A-Pookalam‚ú®

## Basic Details

### Name: Aswin Jim Thuruthippilly

### Project Description

Code-A-Pookalam is an interactive web application that generates beautiful Onam Pookalam designs - traditional Kerala flower  patterns. Users can upload their photos which get automatically stylized to match the vibrant colors of traditional pookalam flowers and placed at the center of the design. The app creates intricate, colorful patterns using geometric shapes and gradients, perfect for celebrating the festival of Onam.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API for real-time pattern generation
- **Face Processing**: MediaPipe for face detection and image processing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, GitHub Copilot
- **Package Management**: npm

# Installation

```bash
npm install
```

# Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Project Documentation

## Features

- üé® **Interactive Pookalam Generation**: Create beautiful Onam flower rangoli patterns
- üì∏ **Photo Integration**: Upload personal photos that get stylized to match traditional colors
- üéØ **Real-time Preview**: See changes instantly as you modify settings
- üé≤ **Color Randomization**: Explore different color combinations with one click
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **High-Quality Export**: Download your creations as PNG images
- üé™ **Festive UI**: Beautiful interface with Onam-themed design elements

## Architecture

The application is built with a modern React architecture:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router for optimal performance
- **State Management**: React hooks for local component state
- **Graphics Engine**: HTML5 Canvas for real-time pattern rendering
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API for photo manipulation and stylization
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system

## How It Works

1. **Pattern Generation**: Uses polar coordinates and geometric algorithms to create layered petal patterns
2. **Color System**: Implements a sophisticated color palette system with shade variations
3. **Face Processing**: Applies color quantization and dithering effects to match pookalam aesthetics
4. **Canvas Rendering**: Real-time drawing with gradients, shapes, and image compositing

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Upload Photo" to select a front-facing image
3. Watch as your photo gets automatically stylized
4. Use "Randomize" to explore different color variations
5. Adjust canvas size if needed (400x400, 600x600, or 800x800)
6. Click "Download" to save your Pookalam as a PNG file
